# JavaEE8-Playground
Test project for playing with Java EE 8 APIs.  Includes early releases for the specifications that will be part of the Java EE 8 Platform (JSR-366 Umbrella Spec). Please use this project for testing the specifications, and provide feedback to the respective JSRs.

Initial release includes support for the following specifications:

* Servlet 4.0 (JSR-369)
* JavaMail 1.6.0 
* Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR-380)
* JSON-P 1.1 (JSR-374)
* JSON-B 1.0 (JSR-367)
* CDI 2.0 (JSR-365)
* JAX-RS 2.1 (JSR-370)
* JSF 2.3 (JSR-372)
* Java EE Security 1.0 (JSR-375)

This project has been tested and verified to work on Payara-5 branch.  It has also been tested with GlassFish 5, although I have seen issues with CDI 2.0 and JSF 2.3 in GlassFish.  Will post an update to resolve as soon as possible (as of 3/29/2017).

I will update the project occasionally to add new demos.  Stay tuned.  Please send feedback to my twitter handle at @javajuneau.

Thanks
